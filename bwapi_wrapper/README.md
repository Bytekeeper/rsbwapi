# This is not the crate you are looking for
This crate provides a binding to some of the data structs of BWAPI and some additional required types.

It can be used to create a client for [BWAPI](https://bwapi.github.io/) (no AI Module mind you). And it is! With the [rsbwapi](https://crates.io/crates/rsbwapi) crate.
Use that instead.

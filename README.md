# rsbwapi

`rsbwapi` is a Rust library for building artificial intelligence (AI) for the popular real-time strategy game Starcraft Broodwar. The library allows you to create and control Starcraft Broodwar bots through the Broodwar API (BWAPI). 

If you're not familiar with BWAPI, it is a community-developed project that provides a C++ interface to interact with Starcraft Broodwar. You can find more information about BWAPI [here](https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi).

To get started with `rsbwapi`, check out the documentation on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/rsbwapi). Also check out the simple [ExampleBot](https://github.com/Bytekeeper/rsbwapi/tree/master/example_bot). Or take a look at my bot [Styx2](https://github.com/Bytekeeper/Styx2).

You may want to join the [SSCAIT Discord](https://discord.gg/frDVAwk), which is a community of Starcraft AI enthusiasts who run regular bot tournaments. You can also check out the [Basil Ladder](https://www.basil-ladder.net/) which is based on SSCAIT but runs a lot more games.

For more information on Starcraft AI development, you can visit the [SSCAIT website](http://www.sscaitournament.com/). There should be enough information to get you started.

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to create an issue on the `rsbwapi` GitHub repository.
